# New Features

* Mirror Scroll no longer erases blocks, the real mirror still will. (Sorry!)
* Standard+Crossed Dungeon now gives you a little magic, a few bombs, and a few arrows if you die or S&Q after meeting your uncle (also works with mirror/scroll)
* Dungeon reminder added to hud for Crossed dungeons
* Blinking red square added to hud and it indicates a boss room is close by. Only appears if you have the compass. (Basic & Crossed)
* Agahnims dungeon items can be started with now
* GUI updates courtesy of Mike T

## Map Features (Crossed only + Experimental)

* Key counters added to hud. Indicates number of keys in chests (found/total). In small key shuffle, this count indicates how many smalls for that dungeon could be outside it.
* Total key indicator added to hud if you have found the map. Counts down from the total number of keys in dungeon to 0 as you collect them.
* Big Key indicator added to hud. Indicates if BK is not in the dungeon, or if BnC guard has it (Probably will move away from hud if kept)

Note: Only one of the key indicator will probably become core at most.

## Experimental changes

* Mirror scroll is now core for non-vanilla Door Shuffle (no longer experimental)
* GT Bosses stay dead in non-vanilla Door Shuffle (no longer experimental)
* Map features listed above are now experimental

# Bug Fixes

* Splashing at hobo no longer prevents you from buying bomb capacity upgrades
* Small vitreous eyeballs will not drop items (DR basic and crossed only)
* In Vanilla doors the HC back hallway area was broken - should be better now - also Trap Doors
* Firebar speed should now be consistent. Ice palace rooms have slow firebars even if shuffled to other dungeons. Others should have normal speed firebars.
